    <h1>Snowball Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of Snowball, including any Snowball mobile applications and websites (the "Services"), and any videos, information, text, graphics, music, sounds, photos or other materials uploaded, downloaded or appearing on the Services (collectively referred to as "Content"). Your access to and use of the Services is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. By accessing or using the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>
    <h2>Basic Terms</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for your use of the Services, for any Content you post to the Services, and for any consequences thereof. The Content you submit, post, or display will be able to be viewed by other users of the Services and through third party services and websites. You should only provide Content that you are comfortable sharing with others under these Terms.</p>
    <p>The Services that Snowball provides are always evolving and the form and nature of the Services that Snowball provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you. In addition, Snowball may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users generally and may not be able to provide you with prior notice. We also retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time without prior notice to you.</p>
    <h2>1. Advertisements</h2>
    <p>The Services may include advertisements, which may be targeted to the Content or information on the Services, queries made through the Services, or other information. The types and extent of advertising by Snowball on the Services are subject to change. In consideration for Snowball granting you access to and use of the Services, you agree that Snowball and its parent, third party providers and partners may place such advertising on the Services or in connection with the display of Content or information from the Services whether submitted by you or others.</p>
    <h2>2. Privacy</h2>
    <p>Any information that you provide to Snowball is subject to our Privacy Policy, which governs our collection and use of your information. You understand that through your use of the Services you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of this information, including the transfer of this information to the United States and/or other countries for storage, processing and use by Snowball. As part of providing you the Services, we may need to provide you with certain communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the Services and your Snowball account, which you may opt-out from receiving.</p>
    <h2>3. Passwords</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password or credentials that you use to access the Services and for any activities or actions under your account. We encourage you to use "strong" passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account and with other accounts that you may connect to your Snowball account (such as Twitter, Facebook, and your email). Snowball cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements.</p>
    <h2>4. Content on the Services</h2>
    <p>All Content, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, is the sole responsibility of the person who originated such Content. We may, but are not required to monitor or control the Content posted via the Services and we cannot take responsibility for such Content. Any use or reliance on any Content or materials posted via the Services or obtained by you through the Services is at your own risk.</p>
    <p>We do not endorse, support, represent or guarantee the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any Content or communications posted via the Services or endorse any opinions expressed via the Services. You understand that by using the Services, you may be exposed to Content that might be offensive, harmful, inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate, or in some cases, postings that have been mislabeled or are otherwise deceptive. Under no circumstances will Snowball be liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any Content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via the Services or broadcast elsewhere.</p>
    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You retain your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on or through the Services. In order to make the Services available to you and other users, Snowball needs a license from you. By submitting, posting or displaying Content on or through the Services, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and distribute such Content in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed).</p>
    <p>You agree that this license includes the right for Snowball to provide, promote, and improve the Services and to make Content submitted to or through the Services available to other companies, organizations or individuals who partner with Snowball for the syndication, broadcast, distribution or publication of such Content on other media and services, subject to our terms and conditions for such Content use. Such additional uses by Snowball, or other companies, organizations or individuals who partner with Snowball, may be made with no compensation paid to you with respect to the Content that you submit, post, transmit or otherwise make available through the Services. We may modify or adapt your Content in order to transmit, display or distribute it over computer networks and in various media and/or make changes to your Content as are necessary to conform and adapt that Content to any requirements or limitations of any networks, devices, services or media. For example, if you choose to share a video through your connected Twitter or Facebook account, we will adapt your Content so that it can be attached to a Tweet or Facebook posting.</p>
    <p>You are responsible for your use of the Services, for any Content you provide, and for any consequences thereof, including the use of your Content by other users and our third party partners. You understand that your Content may be syndicated, broadcast, distributed, or published by our partners and if you do not have the right to submit Content for such use, it may subject you to liability. Snowball will not be responsible or liable for any use of your Content by Snowball in accordance with these Terms. You represent and warrant that you have all the rights, power and authority necessary to grant the rights granted herein to any Content that you submit.</p>

    <h2>12. General Terms</h2>
    <h3>A. Waiver and Severability</h3>
    <p>The failure of Snowball to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.
